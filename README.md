# Weather-App
ðŸŒ¤ Just Launched My Weather App! ðŸŒ¤

I'm excited to share that I've built a fully functional Weather Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrated it with a real-time weather API! This app fetches live weather data based on user input and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions with a clean and responsive UI.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Used:

HTML & CSS for structure and design

JavaScript for logic and interactivity

Weather API for live data integration
